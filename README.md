## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to visualize wich dimension of width I must apply in order to achieve the result...I started using `width: %;`, however when I had to make it responsive, it was totally a mess...the card was adapting to screensize, then I changed it to rem.


### Continued development

One more step closer to my dream of becoming a fullstack
